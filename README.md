## Lab 01 - Maximum Disc Coverage

### Topic Coverage

* Basic Java syntax and semantics
* Object-oriented principles: abstraction and encapsulation

### Problem Description

In this problem, you are given a set of points on a 2D plane. We want to place a unit disc (i.e., a circle of radius 1) so that it covers as many points as possible. <em>Note that this is different from previous exercises where one of the points must be at the centre of the disc.
